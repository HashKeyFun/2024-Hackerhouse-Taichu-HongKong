## Overview
## Our Project: A Meme Coin Platform Built on the HashKey Chain

Our project is an innovative meme coin platform built on the HashKey Chain. A similar example in another ecosystem is **Pumpfun** on the Solana chain. Pumpfun provides liquidity to numerous meme coins, facilitating trading in the Solana chain ecosystem and attracting massive **TVL (Total Value Locked)**. This has significantly boosted the economic vibrancy of the ecosystem.

However, Pumpfun has one notable drawback: there is a possibility that obscene or violent meme content could be introduced to the platform. Such content can undermine the credibility of the project and harm the chain’s ecosystem.

### Problem Solved: Decentralized Token Factory

To address this issue, we designed a Token Factory system that combines the advantages of centralized and decentralized approaches. This system incorporates a centralized review phase to evaluate the appropriateness of content, after which it operates within a decentralized ecosystem. Through this method, we ensure both the reliability and freedom of our platform.

### Implementation Details

1. **AI-Based Obscenity and Violence Detection System**  
   We built an AI-based verification system that automatically evaluates the obscenity and violence level of content. This AI utilizes the following technologies:  

   - **NLP Algorithms**: Models from the BERT and GPT families are employed to analyze text content, identifying obscene language and violent expressions.

   The AI verification system quantifies obscenity and violence, assigning a score. If the score exceeds a certain threshold, the content is automatically rejected. Through this, inappropriate content is initially blocked.

2. **Administrator Review and Final Approval**  
   Content rejected by the AI is forwarded to an administrator for an additional review process. Even the content deemed appropriate by the AI must ultimately receive the administrator’s approval before it can be indexed on the platform’s marketplace. This cooperative structure between AI and human oversight further enhances the reliability and fairness of the system.

### Differentiation from Pumpfun

While Pumpfun contributes to its ecosystem by providing liquidity and facilitating transactions, it lacks a content verification framework, which raises concerns about the potential influx of obscene or violent meme content. This can be a risk factor that undermines the platform’s credibility.

In contrast, our platform sets itself apart in the following ways:

- **Content Verification System**: A dual-layer verification structure, combining AI checks and administrator reviews, ensures safety.
- **Decentralized Ecosystem**: Even after content passes the verification process, it is issued and traded freely in a decentralized structure.
- **Contribution to the HashKey Chain**: This system enhances the credibility of the HashKey Chain, improves user experience, and ultimately brings more liquidity and activity to the ecosystem.

### Conclusion

Our meme coin platform provides an innovative and secure framework for the HashKey Chain ecosystem. By combining AI-based verification with human judgment, we secure the platform’s reliability and fairness, while seamlessly integrating the advantages of both decentralization and centralization.

Through this, we offer long-term value to the HashKey Chain ecosystem—including increased TVL, transaction activation, and heightened user trust. This goes beyond merely facilitating meme coin trading; it plays a crucial role in cultivating a healthier and more sustainable chain ecosystem.
